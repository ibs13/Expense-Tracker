## Expense Tracker

A React expense tracking application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- `useReducer` for complex state management
- Custom hooks to encapsulate business logic
- Derived state and memoization (`useMemo`)
- Controlled forms and edit flows
- Side effects handled with `useEffect`
- Clean separation of UI and logic

### Architecture

- Reducer handles state transitions
- Custom hook exposes a clean API
- UI components are stateless and reusable
